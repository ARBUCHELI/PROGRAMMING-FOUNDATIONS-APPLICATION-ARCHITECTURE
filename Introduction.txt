* Why learn about software architecture?
----------------------------------------
Writing functional code is just one part of software development. 

To create scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications, you need to understand how all the components work together. 

Application architecture is the foundation for building adaptable systems that can handle future changes and growth. 

By learning how to structure your projects properly, you can avoid performance issues and security vulnerabilities while future-proofing your applications to scale smoothly. 

Good architecture also reduces technical debt, those short-term fixes that can lead to bigger problems later on. 

It provides a clear structure that makes it easier for development teams to collaborate and stay aligned on system goals.
