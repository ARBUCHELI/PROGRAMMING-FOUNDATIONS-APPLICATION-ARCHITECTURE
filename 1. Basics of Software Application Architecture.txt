# 1. Basics of Software Application Architecture
------------------------------------------------

* What is software application architecture?
--------------------------------------------
. We work with code, databases, and user interfaces.

	* Before code is written, software architects design the structure of an application.

. The goal is to create software that is robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

	* PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, FRAMEWORKS, AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS THAT SUPPORT AND APPLICATION.

	* MODULES WITH DIFFERENT PURPOSES MANAGE USER DATA, PROCESS PAYMENTS, OR HANDLE SECURITY.

	* USER EXPERIENCE ENSURES THAT THE APPLICATION IS NOT ONLY FUNCTIONAL BUT ALSO EASY TO USE, VISUALLY APPEALING, AND ENJOYABLE FOR USERS.

	* BACKGROUND PROCESSES AND SERVICES KEEP THE APPLICATION RUNNING SMOOTHLY.

	* SECURITY MEASURES KEEP OUT UNAUTHORIZED USERS AND PROTECT DATA. (ENCRYPTION, AUTHENTICATION, ETC)

	* MAINTENANCE AND UPDATES FIX BUGS, IMPROVE PERFORMANCE, AND ADD NEW FEATURES.

. Softwre application architecture is the blueprint, foundation, and framework upon which software is built.
